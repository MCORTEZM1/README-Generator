  ## **Description**
   
  - Employee tracker CMS is a user friendly organizational content manager system. It helps businesses maintain record of departments, roles, and employee structures- and can even track the utilized budget for each department. The application can be configured to suit any company or corporate team structure, but comes preconfigured for a standard car dealership- including a sales, finance, service, parts, and admin departments. Users can create, view, update, and delete departments, roles, and add employees. Employees can be tracked by department and by manager to easily keep track of team structures in a single database. 
  - This application was written using JavaScript, ES6, Node
  - Employee Tracker CMS solves the problem of team management and organization, while making it easy for the user to track and update departments, roles, and employees. 
  - Creating this application increased my foundational understanding of JavaScript overall, while also introducing new skills such as creating a database and server and preparing them for front-end delivery.
