  ## **Description**
   
  - Hello World!!! Welcome to my README generator. This app uses the command line interface to collect user data and generate a professional README.
  - This application was written using JavaScript, ES6, Node
  - This generator solves the issue of having to re-create the wheel, per se, everytime the user needs to create a README file. The motivation to build this project was to gain a better understanding of NODE. 
  - While building this project, I honed my JavaScript skills and how to use NODE. Additionally, how to generate a file and its contents.

  ### **Installation**
  
  Please visit my GitHub Repo and clone the code into your local machine. Open the code in a code editor, such as VS Code. Then `npm i` to install all dependencies. Finally, run the app in the terminal using `node index.js`. You will be prompted by a series of questions and responses to include in the README. Once complete, view your new README in the dist folder of the application. 


  ## **Usage**

  Simply follow the prompts after starting the application to enter your information and details about the project.
